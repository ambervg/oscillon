                    <p>DARK MATTER is a parallel cosmos of expansive light installations where the boundaries between the real and the digital world blur. Visitors embark on a journey through seven partly interactive works, where light, movement, and sound fuse into emotional choreographies of luminous shapes and colors.</p>

                    <p>In 2018, legacy car manufacturers such as Mercedes, BMW, and Audi, taken aback by the advents of Google and Tesla, invested a lot of money in research on autonomous vehicles. They gathered an immense amount of images taken by their cars that they needed to process in order to train their algorithms. This process, called "image segmentation", consists in manually outlining and labelling elements of interest in the image. It is very labor intensive and still cannot be automatized, it is thus outsourced to online micro-workers from the Global South. Unknown Label explores the daily reality of online micro-workers from Venezuela, Kenya, and the Philippines who annotate images for self-driving cars. It investigates the power asymmetries and neocolonialist exploitation involved in the human labor necessary to train AI systems, but also the many micro-gestures of resistance that workers share on private groups. </p>

                    <p>I'm Feeling Lucky is a real-time computer-generated animation that questions relationships to image, geography, virtual space, historical media technology, and mass data collection systems. The work features a 3D virtual landscape that is both historically and geographically ambiguous, generated in real-time using game engine technology. This virtual landscape is then populated with thousands of figures sourced from the vast pool of 360-degree image data collected by Google Street View. These figures are processed through a deep neural network, so they become three-dimensional models in the virtual space, each frozen in their captured pose. The work interrogates mass image collection systems, as many of these individuals may not have been aware that their photo was taken by Google, let alone anticipate being placed in this new, strange setting. Many thousands of figures sourced from all over the world are randomly selected to inhabit the endless landscape together. </p>

                    <p>This multimedia installation consists of two isolated hubs that are part warped confessional, part hallucinatory phone booth. One of the hubs contains a control panel sculpture, while the other hub houses the caressing machine: heated robotic silicone fingers that, once the consent button has been pushed, respond in accordance with the first hub’s interactive sculpture. Thus, it is the participants themselves who, upon entering these hubs, bring to life the defamiliarising sensory realm that is Future Affair. Their physical contact with the objects in each hub allows a thrilling abstracted communication to develop between participants. </p>

                    <p>Two robotic arms (not in captivity), that display the intuitive, emotional bond between a mother and a child. The work is the result of four months of research on the topic of intuition which narrowed down to the intuitive relationship between a mother and a child. The paradox in the work being robots that display this scene, while the spectators don't doubt this relationship for a second. Until the brain takes over and corrects our belly for creating an emotional bond with the two robots.</p>

                    <p>The Recycled Robot is a theater production launching in 2025 based on a short story by Tonke Dragt ( Robot van de Rommelmarkt). Robot artist Bram Ellens has acquired the international theater rights and will stage a unique project together with the Concertgebouw. The story (from 1971) takes place in the future. Every child is dependent on their own robot. Learning is a thing of the past, after all, that's what your robot does. But then one day the robot of the main character Edu breaks down. The only solution is an old-fashioned robot from the flea market offered by a somewhat eccentric figure. There's just one problem; Edu still has to teach the robot everything (except reciting poems because that is the only thing this robot can do). Because of this situation, Edu learns to appreciate 'learning' again and, against his better judgement, he starts to build a bond with the robot. </p>

                    <p>This Dutch podcast from 2doc delves into the increasing presence of robots in our lives, exploring how they are becoming more human-like while we, in turn, adopt more machine-like qualities. How do we as human relate to robots? Rene van Es explores this topic in "Wij zijn robots". To find an answer he brings together artists and theater makers who approach the topic from a creative and philosophical perspective, instead of a viewpoint of efficiency.</p>
