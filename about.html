                    <p>
                        The name "Oscillon" derives from <a href="https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O187634/oscillon-40-photograph-laposky-ben/" style="color: white;">"Oscillon 40"</a>, which is considered to be one of the first digital art pieces. 
                        <br><br> 
                        Laposky used an oscilloscope to manipulate electronic waves that were then displayed on a fluorescent screen. The waves would have been constantly moving and undulating on the screen, but there was no way of recording these movements on paper at this time. By photographing them, the artist was able to capture these images and record them for history. 
                        <br><br> 
                        On the image on the left here you see some more oscillons, namely numbers 4, 17, 45, 12, 21, and 27. These were photographed by Laposky in 1953.

                        Their goal is to set-up a competition where participants can explore the overlap of Art and Technology by working on a project within the theme of "Human Connection through Technology". There is possiblity to explore and aquire new skills, to share knowledge and to grow together.

                            Hi everyone! I'm Francesca, a second-year MSc Robotics student with a passion for computer vision and using tech to make a positive impact. 
                            <br>
                            I’m thrilled to be a mentor for Project Oscillon and can’t wait to support participants in bringing their creative ideas to life. 
                            <br>
                            Outside of robotics, I love traveling, music, crochet, and learning new languages. Excited to meet everyone and see all the amazing projects you’ll create!

                            Hello Oscilloners! I am Leonoor and I just graduated from MSc Robotics. Together with my friends, we have formed a committee (IRo) to make everyone feel included in this studies and also cover topics in robotics that are not widely known yet. Project Oscillon is one of the projects we are currently organizing and I am also very happy to be a mentor for this to see all the cool works that come out of it. 
                            <br>
                            I am very interested in applying robotics in real-life applications, with my current focus on sustainability, art, and daily life. In my free time I do a lot of traveling, painting, visiting concerts, and sports. 
                            <br>
                            But that's it for now! I hope to see you in person during the project to get to know you better as well. :)

                            Hi there! Shanti here, I am a passionate mechanical engineer with additional skills in Aerospace engineering, Rapid prototyping, and Mixed Reality programming. 
                            <br>
                            In my spare time, I practice sports (bouldering) or meet up with friends at the Delft Student e-sports Association. 
                            <br>
                            Graduated from TUDelft in July 2024 and now a mentor for Project Oscillon, I can't wait to collaborate with creative students to make their own robot or AI!
